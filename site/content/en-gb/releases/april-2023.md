For the April release of the {{<product-name>}} we are excited to announce that we have made some key changes to our Satellite Solution. We have removed the need for Azure Key Vault and replaced it with a Dataverse Plugin that uses Application User security instead of values from Key Vault. 

The updated Dataverse plugin will return a list of Solution Artifacts using Application User you provide. Permissions to run the Plugin are managed by new Power Platform Role-based access security. These changes make it easier to install and all resources are now inside Power Platform, so you will no longer need to get an Azure Key Vault provisioned. The key benefits of these new features are that they simplify the installation process and provide a more secure way to access Solution Artifacts. Want to know more about the new satellite changes read our [Get Started - Satellite Guide](/en-gb/get-started/satellite)

We look forward to hearing your feedback and any issues can be reported at [http://aka.ms/ak4pp/issues]().
