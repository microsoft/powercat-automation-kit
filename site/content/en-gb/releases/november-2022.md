With the November Release "[Data Packs](/en-gb/features/datapacks)" are a key new feature.

Refer to the **Getting Started** section to load your first data pack.

Datapacks provide you the ability to optionally import sample data.

The Return on Investment (ROI) data pack allows you to rapidly demonstrate planning, metering and monitoring of return on investment via the Automation Kit Power BI dashboard.

In future milestones we will look to improve the datapacks by including them as an optional part of the Automation Kit automated install process.

The ability to include Data Packs as part of the install will allow for a web based install, rather than the command line install process for this release.

For this release similar the other Power CAT managed kits the {{<product-name>}} has shifted to using the ALM Accelerator to deploy our GitHub releases. You can read more in our [ALM Features](/en-gb/features/alm) page.

In future milestones we will be improving on the existing ALM Accelerator process to include Power Automate Desktop specific tasks that will apply extensions to the CI/CD ALM process.
