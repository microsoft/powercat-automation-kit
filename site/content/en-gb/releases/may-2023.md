For the May release of the {{<product-name>}}, the key work item was the first steps along our [Data Warehouse](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/data-guide/relational-data/data-warehousing) strategy for the Automation Kit. The new features provide the ability run a Power BI Report similar to the out of the box [Desktop flow activity](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-automate/desktop-flows/desktop-flow-activity) report. The key difference in this approach is data is exported to you Azure Datalake and Azure Synapse Analytics so that you can scale and aggregate data across our environments using Azure Synapse.

The [Desktop Flow Monitoring using Azure Synapse link](https://github.com/microsoft/powercat-automation-kit/blob/main/AutomationKit_Flow_BYODL/readme.md) provides more information on this new feature and how you can install it.

You can follow the guide to choose from a range of deployment and security options to meet your monitoring needs as your data volumes, requirements and scale increase.

We look forward to hearing your feedback and any issues can be reported at [http://aka.ms/ak4pp/issues]().
