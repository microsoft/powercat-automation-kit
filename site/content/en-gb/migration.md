The {{<product-name>}} **Migration module** provides you a proven set of tools and guidance based on engagements with customers to accelerate your migration journey. By leveraging the strength of Microsoft Power Platform, Microsoft Azure and the wider Microsoft Cloud services you can:

- Realize your goals of providing cost savings.

- Providing the guardrails to plan, migrate, monitor and setup for a operations model for ongoing usage.

- Leverage conversion samples that you can customize to your process to meet your migration needs.

## RPA Migration Get Started

## Areas Of Focus

The following list provides an overview of areas we a prioritizing for inclusion in the Automation Kit so that we can improve components that you can use in your migration.

> NOTE: These areas of focus may be changed substantially. These changes will occur we continually receive feedback and do prioritization of features to meet customer needs

### Planning

- **Assessment** components that help in the planning phase to assist with identify which Automation solutions from your Automation inventory to migrate to give the best initial impact.

### Management and Governance

- **Return on Investment** a framework for collecting and monitoring the return on investment of the migration program of work so that stakeholders are engaged with migration process and can measure its impact.

- **Governance** A set of components and guidance that assist with Application lifecycle, documentation and ongoing operational monitoring of the migrated solutions.

### Conversion

- **Cloud Integration** sample components that can be used to accelerate conversion process to migrate solutions to the Power Platform, Microsoft Cloud.

- **Non Functional Requirements** covering Quality testing approach, DevOps monitoring, Documentation of migrated solutions

### Automation Center of Excellence

Connecting Power Automation Migration to the Automation Center of Excellence there is a Migration Developer set of skills that overlap with the Automation Kit and the ALM Accelerator.

##### Assess and Plan

The Assess and Plan begins with a free scan of your existing Automation investments using [BluePrint Systems](https://www.blueprintsys.com/) to determine the current complexity and scope. Using this information will help plan for the initial set of automation solutions that can be migrated to Power Automate Desktop.

##### Migrate

The process of migrating from your source migration system to the equivalent Power Automate Desktop actions. Any actions that require the Migration Developer to review and update will be marked TODO comments so that remaining work can easily be identified.

##### Build Finalize

Using the identified TODO comments the Migration Developer completes the remaining migration steps to have the solution working within Power Automate Desktop.

##### Deployment Process

Using the ALM Accelerator solutions can be moved from Development to Production environments having validation checked applied to ensure the TODO items have been removed and target system checks and DLP checks have been applied.

From a maintenance point of view ongoing DLP governance and validation check rules can continued to be applied to fine tune and update deployed solutions overtime.

#### Other Layers

The Migration modules builds on the existing guidance and tooling to support ALM, Infrastructure Components together with Security and Governance and Operational Reporting and Analytics.
