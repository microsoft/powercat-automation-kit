Notes about {{<product-name>}} milestones

- Work starts in our backlog, based on prority, feedback and impact features are selected for inclusion into a milestone

- Milestone progress can be tracked in the [Automation Kit - GitHub Project](https://github.com/orgs/microsoft/projects/486)

- Milestones are a guide only and not a committed timeline

- Features or bugs may not ship in each milestone due to priority bugs or features

- Features or bugs that are not included in a release will be considered for inclusion in the next milestone

- We have a continual process to provide feedback to the core engineering team to look at how features can be deprecated from the Automation Kit and migrated to in product features

- If features are not being used provide a path to de-investing in a feature so that we can focus on higher priority features

- [Office Hours](/office-hours) will be use to share roadmap and assist with priority of new features and bugs to include in each milestone

- Each milestone may include a mixture of functional features and non functional features covering documentation and quality testing improvements

## Release Naming

Each release will be labeled with month and year of release for example November 2022. Additionally we can assign a code name and graphical avatar to the release to give the release a brand that gives additional personality to the release.

Overtime the use of avatars and naming should give us the ability to look back at the family of releases and graphically point out the key features that have been released over time.

Our [Release Naming](/releases/naming) page has more information on this process.
