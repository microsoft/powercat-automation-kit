As an Open Source project built on top of the Power Platform and Microsoft Cloud our goal is to rapidly provide tools and guidance to help accelerate your hyper automation journey.

As part of this journey as we incubate, mature and collaborate with the Core Power Platform engineering team based on your feedback. Using this feedback we will look to include learnings in the core product to improve and respond to your needs.

Given this context there are multiple ways you can contribute to the project to improve our roadmap and features:
