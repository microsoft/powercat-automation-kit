{{<slide  id="slide1" audio="overview/Slide01.mp3" description="Automation Kit Overview" image="overview/Slide01.SVG" >}}

The key scenario of the Automation Kit for Power Platform is to accelerate the usage of the Power Automate for desktop solutions by allowing you define, review, and monitor in near real time the return on investment by automation of existing processes.

{{</slide>}}

{{<slide  id="slide2" audio="overview/Slide02.mp3" description="Automation Kit Features" image="overview/Slide02.SVG" >}}
The key features of the Automation Kit are to allow you to manage, govern and scale automation adoption by leveraging the experiences that we have gained from working with customers worldwide.

We do this by allowing you to monitor in near real time, the planning and impact of projected savings against actual savings based on monitored automation analytics.

The kit focuses on a range of personas from business decision makers, process owners, makers to create the automation process and administration teams so that each user group can measure the impact of the investment.

This process is supported by hyper automation leveraging the value of the Microsoft Cloud to provide and end to end Application Lifecycle management process.

Each of these pieces is supported by the wider Microsoft Security and governance process that allows you to manage and monitor the solutions deployed.

{{<slide  id="slide3" audio="overview/Slide03.mp3" description="Automation Center of Excellence Overview" image="overview/Slide03.SVG" >}}
To successfully operate a Automation Center of excellence there are multiple components to build and grow over time. To accelerate this process the Automation Kit together with the CoE Kit allows you to combine hands-on tooling together with our whitepaper guidance to help you apply different components of your center of excellence.

For example the Automation Backlog can be used to brainstorm potential automation projects and decide on the projects to automate. This can be combined with a robust application lifecycle management process to build, deploy and monitor the solution.

From an operational and risk point of view to control access to connectors and data and provide operational telemetry on the impact of the deployed solutions against the defined targets.

{{</slide>}}

{{<slide  id="slide4" audio="overview/Slide04.mp3" description="Automation Kit vs CoE Kit" image="overview/Slide04.SVG" >}}
The Power Platform CoE Kit include a focus on wider tenant and environment managed.

The automation kit complements these set of tools by focusing specifically on key elements of Power Automate Desktop flows so that the ROI and impact can he demonstrated in near real time.

Over time we will add additional modules to the Automation Kit beyond ROI. For example, we are developing a migration module that allows you to move legacy automation projects to Power Automate at scale.

{{<slide  id="slide5" audio="overview/Slide05.mp3" description="Corporate Automation Strategy" image="overview/Slide05.SVG" >}}

Your corporate automation strategy combines key involvement of your decision makers, process owners, information technology team and risk teams to successfully define, monitor and govern the end to end automation process.

{{</slide>}}

{{<slide  id="slide6" audio="overview/Slide06.mp3" description="Corporate Automation Strategy" image="overview/Slide06.SVG" >}}

Combining these roles together we can follow the process from Corporate Goals, through the process ideation and approval process. Into build and delivery of the selected automation project. Finally the different stakeholders can monitor the impact of the automation project against the expected goals.

{{</slide>}}

{{<slide  id="slide7" audio="overview/Slide07.mp3" description="Leveraging Automation Kit" image="overview/Slide07.SVG" >}}

The Automation Kit enables this process by providing a set of low code components that can be customized. They map to the sample lifecycle allowing data to be aggregated from deployed environments and displayed near real time to stakeholders in the Power BI dashboard.

{{</slide>}}

{{<slide  id="slide8" audio="overview/Slide08.mp3" description="Automation Projects" image="overview/Slide08.SVG" >}}

The automation project application allows you to manage your discovery and approval process. You can use the collected data so you can prioritize the projects that will make the best impact in the organization.

{{</slide>}}

{{<slide  id="slide9" audio="overview/Slide09.mp3" description="Automation Center" image="overview/Slide09.SVG" >}}

The Automation center application can be used by administration team to map the deployed projects to environments to allow monitoring of the solutions against projected goals.

{{</slide>}}

{{<slide  id="slide11" audio="overview/Slide11.mp3" description="Power BI Dashboard" image="overview/Slide11.SVG" >}}

The Power BI dashboard provide the end to end view of the Automation Projects, expected goals and actual savings as automation projects are implemented.

In addition it provides operational monitoring of the health of the deployed solutions.

{{</slide>}}

{{<slide  id="slide12" audio="overview/Slide12.mp3" description="Automation Maturity Model" image="overview/Slide12.SVG" >}}

The automation maturity model can be a useful framework to determine where you are on your automation journey. They can provide a roadmap for areas that can be automated over time to scale to more defined, capable and efficient process.

The Automation Kit and CoE Kit provide you useful tools and guidance to help you accelerate your journey to move to high levels of automation.

{{</slide>}}

{{<slide  id="slide15" audio="overview/Slide15.mp3" description="Automation Kit Getting Started" image="overview/Slide15.SVG" >}}

The key change has been to improve our getting started process so that it can be tailor to your role and guide you on the path to getting started as quickly as possible.

{{</slide>}}

{{<slide  id="slide16" audio="overview/Slide16.mp3" description="What's Next" image="overview/Slide16.SVG" >}}

We have a continual process of looking at items that are prioritized from out backlog for inclusion in each milestone. Each milestone is a guide of when the feature may be released. This release schedule may change based on priority feedback from customers and meeting our quality gates prior to release.

Overtime features from the Automation Kit will be considered for inclusion in the the out of the box in product experience. As this occurs features will be deprecated from the Automation Kit to allow migration to the in product features.

For features where telemetry and customer impact show limited impact we will look to de-invest from those features so that we can focus on higher priority areas.
