The design goal of the [Authoring](/contribution/authoring) process is to allow a co-creation model as a core team building and maintaining the {{<product-name>}} and the community. This community could be with Customers or Partners.

The content is authored in [Markdown](https://learn.microsoft.com/contribute/markdown-reference) similar to the [Microsoft Learn site](https://learn.microsoft.com).

To create interactive content authors can use shortcodes to engage the reader and provide interactive feedback and experiences for each page.
