Using the Process Advisor Import process simplifies the amount of information that needs to be entered and offers you a choice of options to integrate with you Automation Project.

Reviewers of the Automation Project and take into account the Process Advisor results when considering if they should Approve or Deny the Automation Project request.

NOTE:

1. We currently have items on the Automation Kit backlog to add additional templates and applications in upcoming milestones that enable you quickly get started with integrating your Processed Advisor data with the Automation Kit.

2. More information on configuring your Process Advisor analysis with a custom workspace can be found in [Load your process analytics in power bi](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-automate/process-mining-pbi-workspace#load-your-process-analytics-in-power-bi)

### Power Automate Templates

You could use out of the box Power BI connector actions and Power Automate cloud flows to create or update you Automation Kit projects.
