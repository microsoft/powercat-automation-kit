Notes about {{<product-name>}} milestones

- Work starts in our backlog, based on prority, feedback and impact features are selected for inclusion into a milestone

- Milestone progress can be tracked in the [Automation Kit - GitHub Project](https://github.com/orgs/microsoft/projects/486)

- Milestones are a guide only and not a committed timeline

- Features or bugs may not ship in each milestone due to priority bugs or features

- Features or bugs that are not included in a release will be considered for inclusion in the next milestone

- We have a continual process to provide feedback to the core engineering team to look at how features can be deprecated from the Automation Kit and migrated to in product features

- If features are not being used provide a path to de-investing in a feature so that we can focus on higher priority features

- [Office Hours](/office-hours) will be use to share roadmap and assist with prioritization of new features and bugs to include in each milestone

- Each milestone may include a mixture of functional features and non functional features covering documentation and quality testing improvements
