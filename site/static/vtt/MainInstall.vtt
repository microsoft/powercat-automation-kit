3
00:00:14.554 --> 00:00:15.914
us to the first time setup guide.

4
00:00:16.822 --> 00:00:18.312
The first key prerequisite is the

5
00:00:18.312 --> 00:00:20.252
Creator kit install.The Creator Kit

6
00:00:21.072 --> 00:00:22.642
requires the Power Apps component

8
00:00:25.262 --> 00:00:26.882
Let's step through that setup process.

9
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.400
From the Power Platform Admin web

10
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.460
portal, select your environment, expand

11
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:32.054

and toggle the feature on.

13
00:00:41.172 --> 00:00:42.362
Then save the changes.

14
00:00:43.202 --> 00:00:44.742
Now that the environment features is

15
00:00:44.742 --> 00:00:46.522
enabled, let's install the Creator Kit

16
00:00:46.522 --> 00:00:47.632
from the app source portal.

17
00:00:51.235 --> 00:00:52.885
Select the Get it Now button to install

18
00:00:52.885 --> 00:00:54.505

Select your environment and agree to the

21
00:01:05.731 --> 00:01:07.391

solution into your environment.

24
00:01:12.959 --> 00:01:14.659
Now that the Creator Kit is installed,

25
00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:16.509
let's open the solution and verify that

26
00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:18.239
the reference application loads and the

27
00:01:18.239 --> 00:01:20.059
Creator Kit controls are displayed as

28
00:01:20.059 --> 00:01:20.629
expected.

29
00:01:21.885 --> 00:01:23.445
Next, let's download the command line

30
00:01:23.445 --> 00:01:25.165
installer for the automation kit from

31
00:01:25.165 --> 00:01:26.875
the Automation Kit GitHub releases.

32
00:01:42.557 --> 00:01:44.487
Once the zip file has been downloaded,

33
00:01:44.487 --> 00:01:46.557
select Properties. Unblock the zip file.

34
00:01:47.357 --> 00:01:49.087
Then extract the zip file contents.

35
00:01:53.441 --> 00:01:55.181
Finally, let's download and install the

36
00:01:55.181 --> 00:01:56.881
Power Platform Command Line Interface

37
00:01:56.881 --> 00:01:58.591
tools so that we can begin the install.

38
00:02:07.792 --> 00:02:09.482
Now, with the prerequisites required for

39
00:02:09.482 --> 00:02:10.792
setup out of the way, let's start

40
00:02:10.792 --> 00:02:12.432
PowerShell and begin the install of the

41
00:02:12.432 --> 00:02:13.952
main solution.We change to the

42
00:02:14.752 --> 00:02:16.592
downloaded and extracted folder.Then

43
00:02:17.392 --> 00:02:19.002
start the PowerShell install command.

44
00:02:23.955 --> 00:02:25.515
Then select Y to start the install

45
00:02:25.515 --> 00:02:27.265
wizard to collect the setup parameters.

46
00:02:28.151 --> 00:02:29.209
Select Main Install

47
00:02:30.643 --> 00:02:31.663
and then select Next.

48
00:02:33.296 --> 00:02:34.606
Now we can confirm that all the

49
00:02:34.606 --> 00:02:35.996
prerequisites are in place.

50
00:02:37.133 --> 00:02:38.813
The first parameter is the environment

51
00:02:38.813 --> 00:02:40.643
URL.We can get this from the session

52
00:02:41.463 --> 00:02:43.083
details of the Powerapps portal of the

53
00:02:43.083 --> 00:02:44.763

54
00:02:44.763 --> 00:02:45.193
wizard.

55
00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.800
Next, we copy the home environment URL

56
00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.070
from the browser address bar.

57
00:02:54.675 --> 00:02:56.255
The next questions allow you to create

58
00:02:56.255 --> 00:02:57.855
the required connection in the selected

59
00:02:57.855 --> 00:02:59.585
Power Platform environment.For each

60
00:03:00.395 --> 00:03:01.575
connection you can create a new

61
00:03:01.575 --> 00:03:02.955
connection where you will be prompted to

62
00:03:02.955 --> 00:03:04.835
confirm the creation.Once the connection

63
00:03:05.635 --> 00:03:07.375
is created, you can copy the address bar

64
00:03:07.375 --> 00:03:09.375
URL for each connection and paste the

65
00:03:09.375 --> 00:03:10.755
address back in the setup wizard

66
00:03:10.755 --> 00:03:11.245

67
00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:21.529
Once complete, press next to move to the

68
00:03:21.529 --> 00:03:22.919

69
00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:24.179
e-mail address of the default

70
00:03:24.179 --> 00:03:25.789
automation project approver and

71
00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:27.549
configure the install settings to set U

72
00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:29.289
optional sample data for demonstration

73
00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:30.959
purposes and enable main solution

74
00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:32.519
calculations, approval and

75
00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:33.349
synchronization.

76
00:03:34.813 --> 00:03:36.323
Now you can press next to move to the

77
00:03:36.323 --> 00:03:37.773
final download page where you can

78
00:03:37.773 --> 00:03:39.463
download the configured settings.Then

79
00:03:40.283 --> 00:03:41.663
copy the downloaded file to the

80
00:03:41.663 --> 00:03:43.713
automation kit install folder downloaded

81
00:03:43.713 --> 00:03:44.173
earlier.

82
00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:46.709
With the configuration file downloaded,

83
00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.259
you can switch back to the PowerShell

84
00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:50.219
window to press Y to begin the install.

85
00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:52.549
You will be prompted to log in and the

86
00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:53.519
install will begin.

87
00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:58.299
Once the main solution is successfully

88
00:03:58.299 --> 00:03:59.749
installed, you can switch back to the

89
00:03:59.749 --> 00:04:01.759
install environment.Select Automation

90
00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:04.379
Coe Main.Then open the Automation

91
00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:06.219
roject application.

92
00:04:11.384 --> 00:04:12.937
You will notice that Edit Project is

93
00:04:12.937 --> 00:04:14.508
grayed out.To enable this feature, you

94
00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:16.775
will need to assign the Power Platform

95
00:04:16.775 --> 00:04:18.118
roles to the user so that you can

96
00:04:18.118 --> 00:04:20.242
administer, manage, and view automation

97
00:04:20.242 --> 00:04:22.004
projects.The roles can be configured

98
00:04:22.804 --> 00:04:24.394
from the Power Platform Admin Center.

99
00:04:25.184 --> 00:04:26.689
After these settings are applied and

100
00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:27.956
switching back to the automation

101
00:04:27.956 --> 00:04:29.451
project, you will see that as the user

102
00:04:29.451 --> 00:04:30.813
was configured to have a minimum of

103
00:04:30.813 --> 00:04:32.318
contributor permissions, they can now

104
00:04:32.318 --> 00:04:33.632
add automation projects.

105
00:04:34.568 --> 00:04:36.428
This completes the automation kit main

106
00:04:36.428 --> 00:04:37.598
solution installation.
