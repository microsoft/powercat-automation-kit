1
00:00:11.013 --> 00:00:12.493
Now that the Automation Kit main

2
00:00:12.493 --> 00:00:14.113
solution has been installed via the

3
00:00:14.113 --> 00:00:15.843
command line installer.Let's start a

4
00:00:16.633 --> 00:00:18.353
command line install of the Automation

5
00:00:18.353 --> 00:00:19.063
Kit Satellite.

6
00:00:24.325 --> 00:00:25.785
Selecting the satellite solution,

7
00:00:25.785 --> 00:00:26.375
install.

8
00:00:29.191 --> 00:00:31.441
Indicate that the April 2023 or newer

9
00:00:31.441 --> 00:00:32.441
install will be made.

10
00:00:33.295 --> 00:00:35.015
And that installing as a user with

11
00:00:35.015 --> 00:00:37.055
System Administrator rights.Next is to

12
00:00:37.855 --> 00:00:39.495
set up the environment so that the Power

13
00:00:39.495 --> 00:00:41.105
App Component Framework feature is

14
00:00:41.105 --> 00:00:41.565
enabled.

15
00:00:42.515 --> 00:00:44.215
Let's open the Power Platform Admin

16
00:00:44.215 --> 00:00:46.135
Center. Select the environment.Then we

17
00:00:47.005 --> 00:00:47.975
can select settings.

18
00:00:49.807 --> 00:00:51.277
Expand the product features.

19
00:00:55.591 --> 00:00:57.091
And toggle the required setting.

20
00:00:59.774 --> 00:01:00.964
Then save the changes.

21
00:01:01.822 --> 00:01:03.372
Now the feature is enabled, we can

22
00:01:03.372 --> 00:01:05.452
continue.The next step is to install the

23
00:01:06.302 --> 00:01:07.702
Creator kit in this environment.

24
00:01:09.005 --> 00:01:10.545
Using the resources of the Power

25
00:01:10.545 --> 00:01:12.395
Platform Admin Center, we can select the

26
00:01:12.395 --> 00:01:14.305
Creator Kit.And install the Creator Kit

27
00:01:15.135 --> 00:01:16.165
to the target environment.

28
00:01:19.335 --> 00:01:21.025
After agreeing to the terms of service

29
00:01:21.025 --> 00:01:22.675
and selecting Install, the Creator Kit

30
00:01:22.675 --> 00:01:23.635
install will start.

31
00:01:27.186 --> 00:01:28.956
Let's validate that the Creator Kit is

32
00:01:28.956 --> 00:01:30.746
correctly set up and configured.In the

33
00:01:31.576 --> 00:01:33.096
selected environment, we can open the

34
00:01:33.096 --> 00:01:35.352
Creator kit reference canvas application.

35
00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:41.590
And validate that the Creator Kit

36
00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.450
controls are visible as expected.

37
00:01:48.724 --> 00:01:50.234
Now we have validated that the Creator

38
00:01:50.234 --> 00:01:52.244
Kit is installed. The next step if you

39
00:01:52.364 --> 00:01:54.044
have not installed the Microsoft Power

40
00:01:54.044 --> 00:01:56.034
Platform CLI is to use the link to

41
00:01:56.034 --> 00:01:58.014
install the Power Platform CLI to your

42
00:01:58.014 --> 00:01:58.484
machine.

43
00:02:05.092 --> 00:02:06.762
Next, ensure that your environment has

44
00:02:06.762 --> 00:02:08.202
the correct Data Loss Prevention

45
00:02:08.202 --> 00:02:09.172
policies applied.

46
00:02:10.091 --> 00:02:11.851
As the final prerequisite check ensures

47
00:02:11.851 --> 00:02:13.541
that you have an Azure Active Directory

48
00:02:13.541 --> 00:02:14.541
application created.

49
00:02:15.371 --> 00:02:16.791
From the Azure portal, you can get an

50
00:02:16.791 --> 00:02:18.491
existing Azure Active Directory

51
00:02:18.491 --> 00:02:20.541
application or create a new Azure Active

52
00:02:20.541 --> 00:02:21.631
Directory application.

53
00:02:23.514 --> 00:02:25.094
In this case we will register a new

54
00:02:25.094 --> 00:02:25.844
application.

55
00:02:31.076 --> 00:02:33.116
We can use the registered application ID

56
00:02:33.116 --> 00:02:34.666
as part of the setup wizard later.

57
00:02:40.498 --> 00:02:42.008
Next, in the setup wizard, the target

58
00:02:42.008 --> 00:02:43.378
environment and connections are

59
00:02:43.378 --> 00:02:43.858
collected.

60
00:02:44.694 --> 00:02:46.134
First, the setup wizard needs the

61
00:02:46.134 --> 00:02:47.714
address of the environment home page

62
00:02:47.714 --> 00:02:48.844
that you want to install to.

63
00:02:50.532 --> 00:02:52.092
You can open the Power Platform web

64
00:02:52.092 --> 00:02:52.602
portal.

65
00:02:54.179 --> 00:02:56.109
Verify that the Creator Kit solution has

66
00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:56.819
been installed.

67
00:03:01.091 --> 00:03:02.781
Then copy the environment location from

68
00:03:02.781 --> 00:03:04.471
the browser and copy it back into the

69
00:03:04.471 --> 00:03:05.141
setup wizard.

70
00:03:07.516 --> 00:03:09.096
Now you can use the Create button to

71
00:03:09.096 --> 00:03:10.506
create each of the connections in your

72
00:03:10.506 --> 00:03:12.166
environment required by the solution.

73
00:03:12.966 --> 00:03:14.486
Once the connection has been created,

74
00:03:14.486 --> 00:03:16.056
you can copy the web address of the

75
00:03:16.056 --> 00:03:17.806
created connection into the setup wizard

76
00:03:17.806 --> 00:03:18.196
field.

77
00:03:29.649 --> 00:03:31.299
The environment variables and settings

78
00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:32.719
will collect information about the

79
00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:34.539
environment you intend to install into.

80
00:03:35.369 --> 00:03:37.149
The first setting is the e-mail address

81
00:03:37.149 --> 00:03:39.049
to send operational reports and alerts

82
00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:39.299
to.

83
00:03:40.117 --> 00:03:42.177
Next is the ID of the automation project

84
00:03:42.177 --> 00:03:43.557
from your main environment.You can

85
00:03:44.357 --> 00:03:45.877
access this by opening the Power

86
00:03:45.877 --> 00:03:47.047
Platform portal for your main

87
00:03:47.047 --> 00:03:48.417
environment.Navigating to your

88
00:03:49.197 --> 00:03:50.867
automation Coe main solution.

89
00:03:58.902 --> 00:04:00.242
Then selecting the details of the

90
00:04:00.242 --> 00:04:02.392
automation project application and copy

91
00:04:02.392 --> 00:04:04.082
the ID back into the setup wizard.

92
00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.940
Next is the base desktop flow address

93
00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.760
from the Power Automate web portal.As

94
00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:14.450
indicated in the documentation, only the

95
00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.100
part up to environments is required.

96
00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:18.140
Let's look at an example.

97
00:04:25.458 --> 00:04:27.078
Next we need the satellite environment

98
00:04:27.078 --> 00:04:28.798
ID.This can be obtained the session

99
00:04:29.628 --> 00:04:31.538
details dialog of the Powerapps web

100
00:04:31.538 --> 00:04:31.938
portal.

101
00:04:37.277 --> 00:04:38.997
Next we need the environment name of the

102
00:04:38.997 --> 00:04:40.617
satellite environment.We can get this

103
00:04:41.417 --> 00:04:43.207
from the Power Platform Admin Center web

104
00:04:43.207 --> 00:04:43.617
portal.

105
00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:46.049
Then the satellite environment region.

106
00:04:46.869 --> 00:04:48.949
This is also in the Power Platform Admin

107
00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:49.829
Center web portal.

108
00:04:55.008 --> 00:04:56.478
Then the unique environment name for the

109
00:04:56.478 --> 00:04:57.908
satellite environment.This can be

110
00:04:58.748 --> 00:05:00.588
obtained from the Session details dialog

111
00:05:00.588 --> 00:05:02.588
of the Powerapps web portal.Note

112
00:05:03.438 --> 00:05:04.648
you will have to append a region

113
00:05:04.648 --> 00:05:06.648
specific extension to the pasted value.

114
00:05:11.674 --> 00:05:13.434
Then repeat the same process to obtain

115
00:05:13.434 --> 00:05:15.174
the unique environment, except this time

116
00:05:15.174 --> 00:05:16.554
the value needs to be from the main

117
00:05:16.554 --> 00:05:18.254
environment.Let's look at an example of

118
00:05:19.074 --> 00:05:19.314
that.

119
00:05:37.931 --> 00:05:39.811
Now you will require the environment URL

120
00:05:39.811 --> 00:05:41.251
for the satellite environment. You can

121
00:05:41.251 --> 00:05:42.891
obtain this from the session details.

122
00:06:39.568 --> 00:06:41.338
The options page is the final set of

123
00:06:41.338 --> 00:06:42.938
options you will need to provide in the

124
00:06:42.938 --> 00:06:44.658
setup wizard.You will need to indicate

125
00:06:45.458 --> 00:06:46.708
if you want to store the extracted

126
00:06:46.708 --> 00:06:48.718
script in dataverse for reporting.If you

127
00:06:49.528 --> 00:06:50.938
want to enable the cloud flows to

128
00:06:50.938 --> 00:06:52.738
synchronize data to the main environment.

129
00:06:53.568 --> 00:06:55.848
And enable the Azure AP app registration

130
00:06:55.848 --> 00:06:57.568
so that the automation solution manager

131
00:06:57.568 --> 00:06:59.388
can query solution artifacts.For the

132
00:07:00.198 --> 00:07:02.098
application name and ID, we can copy

133
00:07:02.098 --> 00:07:03.198
these to the setup wizard.

134
00:07:09.668 --> 00:07:11.288
Then select next to move to the final

135
00:07:11.288 --> 00:07:12.908
setup wizard step to download the

136
00:07:12.908 --> 00:07:13.868
configured settings.

137
00:08:00.061 --> 00:08:02.061
The install can take 10 to 15 minutes to

138
00:08:02.061 --> 00:08:02.521
complete.

139
00:08:03.329 --> 00:08:05.159
Once the install completes successfully,

140
00:08:05.159 --> 00:08:06.399
you can then open the satellite

141
00:08:06.399 --> 00:08:08.289
environment and use the automation kit

142
00:08:08.289 --> 00:08:09.629
Satellite Solution Manager.
